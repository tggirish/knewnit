Charlie Chaplin used to spend lot of time by himself. Shahrukh Khan spends lot of time by himself thinking of ideas. Winston Churchill used to write his most important letters and speeches in the wee hours of the night. Why cant these principles of introspection and self-research be applied to organizational leadership.

You've heard of people like Elon Musk and Jeff Immelt (General Electric CEO). Reading about them leads us to assume that business greatness requires little sleep and even less time with loved ones. Immelt, for example, has worked<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://34.gs/rqs5" data-qt-tooltip="34.gs"> 100+ hours per week for his entire career</a></span>.</p>
<p class="qtext_para">But is that the true way to reach success? To sacrifice everything else in your life, from your health to your relationships, just to achieve career success?</p>
<p class="qtext_para">There is a better way.</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>Spending 10 hours a week just thinking. </strong><br><br>If you're anything like me, then it might sound completely counter-intuitive at first, and it may even strike you as something that goes against everything we think we know about what a successful leader does.</p>
<p class="qtext_para">But did you know that Warren Buffett has spent <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://34.gs/e5jk" data-qt-tooltip="34.gs">80% of his career thinking</a></span>? Yes, the same Warren Buffett that built the fourth largest company in the country isn't nearly as busy as you are.</p>
<p class="qtext_para">"That's what created [one of the] world's most successful business records in history. He has a lot of time to think,"<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://34.gs/sf4h" data-qt-tooltip="34.gs"> Charlie Munger</a></span>, Buffett's long-time business partner, has said of his unusual approach to productivity.</p>
<p class="qtext_para">Buffett's schedule may seem like an anomaly. In reality, he's a trailblazer. Thanks in part to his example, over the past few years, several high-profile CEOs have come out against the norm of constant busyness. They argue that critical thinking time is essential in a complex, rapidly-changing digital economy.</p>
<p class="qtext_para">AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, for instance, makes his executives spend<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://34.gs/2by9" data-qt-tooltip="34.gs"> 10% of their day</a></span>, or four hours per week, just thinking. Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn,<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://34.gs/evwr" data-qt-tooltip="34.gs"> schedules 2 hours</a></span> of uninterrupted thinking time per day. Jack Dorsey is a<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://34.gs/a14y" data-qt-tooltip="34.gs"> serial wanderer</a></span>. Bill Gates is famous for<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://34.gs/t5u4" data-qt-tooltip="34.gs"> taking a week off twice a year</a></span> just to reflect deeply without interruption.</p>
<p class="qtext_para">I do the same. At my $250+ million company,<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://34.gs/331a" data-qt-tooltip="34.gs"> O2E (Ordinary to Exceptional) Brands</a></span>, which includes brands like<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://34.gs/vq1c" data-qt-tooltip="34.gs"> 1-800-GOT-JUNK?</a></span>, I set aside all of Monday for thinking. I believe that, whatever your business type or size, you can and should make time for it too.</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>But why should you spend 10 hours a week thinking?</strong><br><br><em>"Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the ax." -- Abraham Lincoln</em><br><br>Most people see leadership as a sport where success is determined by hard work. Instead, I like to think of business as being more like surgery.<br><br>My father was one of the top surgeons in Canada, so when I was young, I saw how doctors aim to have maximum impact with minimum intervention. Like Lincoln chopping down a tree, accomplishing this is about careful planning. The actual surgery -- the physical work -- is only a small part of the process.</p>
<p class="qtext_para">I approach business the same way. The Mondays I devote to thinking allow me to operate with surgical precision during the rest of the week.</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>This is how I spend my 10 hours thinking:</strong></p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>Step #1: Schedule the whole day in your calendar</strong></p>
<p class="qtext_para">Are other people constantly taking your time and dictating your priorities? If so, the first step to finding time to devote to thinking is to take control of your calendar. Let people know that you won't respond to emails or phone calls on a particular day, unless there's an emergency.</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>Step #2: Do NOT go to your office</strong><br><br>My best ideas come when I'm not in the office, so I often spend the day wandering around Vancouver. I pick where to go based on the type of thinking that I need to do. On a given Monday, I might go through six coffee shops. I might walk in the forest, take a bike ride, hang out on the beach, sit on a park bench, or even have a glass of wine. Whenever I feel stuck, I move locations.</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>Step #3: Bring your journal</strong></p>
<p class="qtext_para">Writing is a powerful way to capture your ideas and get them into an organized, actionable form. The key is not to censor or judge yourself -- just spill your thoughts onto paper without criticism or even evaluation. There are many ways to do this. I'm a very visual person, so my notebook is filled with pictures, arrows and words. Find what works best for you.</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>Step #4: Reschedule or shorten meetings you have later in the week</strong><br><br>As I'm out of the office all Monday, my Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are usually spent in back-to-back meetings. I set aside 15 minutes on Monday to review the meetings that are set up for the week and compare them to my priorities. If a meeting isn't a high priority, I will ask my assistant to either reschedule it or shorten it.</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>Step #5: Prune your to-do list for the week</strong></p>
<p class="qtext_para">Most of those meetings lead to action steps. Over the course of the week, tasks pile up and my to-do list can become so long that it's unrealistic for me to complete all of it. Rather than blindly checking off items as they come up, I use my thinking day to review the list and evaluate which ones are truly a priority. I ask myself: 'Should we really action this?' Often, I find that what seemed important at first isn't anymore.</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>Step #6: Identify your top three outcomes for the day</strong></p>
<p class="qtext_para">Besides planning your week to come and reviewing your to-do list, set three goals for your thinking day and jot them down. This will ensure you get the maximum impact from those open hours.</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>Step #7: Use powerful questions to encourage deep thinking</strong></p>
<p class="qtext_para">You will also want to devote some of your time to thinking deeply about your priorities and the direction of your business. I find prompts are helpful for this. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<p class="qtext_para">Am I doing the right things with the right people?</p>
<p class="qtext_para">What's most important? What am I good at?</p>
<p class="qtext_para">What am I bad at?</p>
<p class="qtext_para">How can I spend more time doing what I'm good at?</p>
<p class="qtext_para">How can I spend less time doing what I'm bad at?</p>
<p class="qtext_para">Alternatively, I'll write out a goal and think about how I can strategically move toward it.</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>Step #8: Set aside time to solve your biggest problems</strong></p>
<p class="qtext_para">As important as big-picture thinking is, every business will need to solve shorter-term problems. A portion of your day can also be spent investigating challenging issues and brainstorming ways to push through them.</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>Step #9: Set aside time to think of new ideas</strong></p>
<p class="qtext_para">Reacting to problems is essential, but so is proactively coming up with new ideas to better your business. Set aside some time to brainstorm new ways of doing things, or new opportunities to explore.</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><strong>The results will shock you.</strong></p><br/>
