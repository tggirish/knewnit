Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Hi, I am Girish. I have been doing software programming for the past 20 years. I started in the days where Oracle Developer 3.0 and Reports1.1 were considered state of the art. I have seen applications grow from 1-tier to n-tier, from one physical server to cloud. they say the current lifespan of a software application is 18 months. I am creating this site as a research hub for my pet projects and to socialize my findings to whoever may come looking for it. Even though I try to vary my examples, my samples will lean more towards financial and retail applications in Web platform.
