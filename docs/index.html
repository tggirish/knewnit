Leaders set direction, have vision, and inspire action. Leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to "win" as a team or an organization. Leadership is dynamic, exciting and inspring. There are different types of leaders such as revolutionary leaders, political leaders and organizational leaders. Are there different types of leadership styles? Are the principles of leaders different? Click to read the articles written by me on leadership.

Hi, I am Girish. I have been doing software programming for the past 20 years. I started in the days where Oracle Developer 3.0 and Reports1.1 were considered state of the art. I have seen applications grow from 1-tier to n-tier, from one physical server to cloud. they say the current lifespan of a software application is 18 months. I am creating this site as a research hub for my pet projects and to socialize my findings to whoever may come looking for it. Even though I try to vary my examples, my samples will lean more towards financial and retail applications in Web platform. Please click this section for my past recordings and upcoming speaking engagements.<br/>
